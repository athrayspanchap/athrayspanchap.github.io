            <p class="lead">

My name is Subramania Athiray Panchapakesan (I go by Athiray). I’m currently a
NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center,
Huntsville, AL, where I’m developing the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray
Spectrometer (MaGIXS), sounding rocket experiment and study the solar X-ray emission
to understand the heating time scales in the solar corona. Previously, I was a
postdoctoral associate (2016 - 2019) at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, worked on
the third rocket flight of <a href="https://www.foxsi.umn.edu/">Focusing Optics
    X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI)</a>. I played an important role in the
calibration of hard X-ray detectors FOXSI and studied the
differential emission measure of small microflares by combining data from
SDO/AIA, Hinode/XRT and FOXSI-2. In May of 2015, I completed
my PhD in the Indian Space Resarch organisation, <a
    href="http://www.iiap.res.in/">Indian Institute of Astrophysics</a> under
the supervison of Dr. Sreekumar. My dissertation, <em>Study of lunar surface
    chemistry using Swept Charge Devices</em>, can be found <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PhDT.......227A/abstract">here</a>.
